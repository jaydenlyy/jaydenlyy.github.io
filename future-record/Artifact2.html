            <div class="space">Artifact Analysis: Artificial Intelligence and Human Interaction<br>Date: 06062049<br><br>Artificial Intelligence acts as an essential part of our daily lives today, as it helps us get up in the morning, sets the coffee, makes us breakfast and so much more. Our reliance on this technology has lead to a global loss of identity and human interaction. We would much rather interact with AI for getting things done than to look to other human beings for help. We trade efficiency and the convenience of AI technology for human connection, robotics have evolved to become so much more effective in the field compared to a regular human being could ever be. I would not be surprised if AI was the next thing to replace us humans completely...</div>

        <div class="containerbox2">Ever since the development of Alexa, humanity has grown their obsession with Artificial Intelligence up until the point where every major corporation had their signature household AI device for their customers. A best seller was the Robotics Industry, a humanoid replacement for regular humans.<br><br>AI optimized for function but is also lifelike with built in progressive learning capibilities for emotions and feeling. Over time humanity has grown an attachment to such devices, resulting in the ultimate loss of genuine human interaction and identity.
